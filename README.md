metropolitano-backend
=====================

Backend used in Metropolitano, a Firefox OS app.

For now, the only backend required in this app is to retrieve a list of Tweets from a Twitter account. Then this list is printed and with JavaScript (in metropolitano app - https://github.com/juaneladio/metropolitano ) is parsed as JSON.
